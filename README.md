# guess_number

## first option
- the computer chooses a random number for a range that I define in the first place
- if give a guess 
- the computer reacts: 
    - too high
    - too low
    - that was correct

# upgraded
- add difficulty level
    - variating the range where the number can be in 
    - variating the time to get the answer
    - future project: record system
    - maybe smarten code by using self.init modul ...
    - future project: when the user should make an input create visual dot or blinking character 
    - future: start the game in the terminal 
    
## second option 
- I choose a number 
- computer guesses 
- user responds
    - too high
    - too low
    - that was correct
